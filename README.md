# 💘 The Unrejectable Valentine Proposal 💘

Ever wanted to ask your crush out in the most **tech-savvy** (and slightly sneaky) way possible? Well, I did! So I built a **fun little website** using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** that asks my crush out for **Valentine's Day**. But here’s the catch – there’s no way to say NO! 😈

## 🎯 How It Works
- The site asks one simple question: **"Will you be my Valentine?"**
- There are two buttons: **YES** and **NO**
- But... the **NO** button **runs away** whenever the user tries to click it! 😆
- The only option left? **YES, of course!** 💖

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- **HTML** – For the structure
- **CSS** – For styling (gotta make it look cute, right?)
- **JavaScript** – For making the NO button act like a scaredy-cat

## 🤓 Why I Made This?
- Because traditional texts are boring.
- Because I like adding a little **tech twist** to romance.
- Because rejection isn’t an option. (Just kidding... or am I? 🤔)
